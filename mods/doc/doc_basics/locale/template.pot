"Minetest is a free software game engine for games based on voxel gameplay, "

"created by Perttu Ahola (alias “celeron55”)."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua

"The player is thrown into a huge world made out of cubes or blocks. These "
"cubes usually make the landscape they blocks can be removed and placed "

"much more complex than this."

"A core feature of Minetest is the built-in modding capability. Mods modify "

"Mining (or digging) is the process of breaking blocks to remove them. To "

msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "Short explanation:"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"Blocks require a mining tool to be mined. Different blocks are mined by "
"different mining tools, and some blocks can not be mined by any tool. Blocks "
"vary in toughness and tools vary in strength. Mining tools will wear off "
"over time. The mining time and the tool wear depend on the block and the "
"mining tool. The fastest way to find out how efficient your mining tools are "
"is by just trying them out on various blocks. Any items you gather by mining "
"go straight into your inventory."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "Detailed explanation:"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"Mineable blocks have mining properties (based on groups) and a toughness "
"level. Mining tools have the same properties. Each mining property of a "
"block also has a rating, while tools can be able to break blocks within a "
"range of ratings."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "In order to mine a block, these conditions need to be met:"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The block and tool share at least one mining property for which they have "
"a matching rating"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The tool's toughness level is equal or less than the block's toughness "
"level"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"Example: A block with the mining property “cracky”, rating 3 and toughness "
"level 0 can only be broken by a tool which is able to break “cracky” blocks "
"at rating 3 and it must have a toughness level of 0 or larger."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"The time it takes to mine a block depends on the ratings and the toughness "
"levels of both tool and block."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The base mining time depends on the ratings of the block and the mining "
"speed of the tool"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The mining speed of the tool differs for each mining property and its "
"rating"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The toughness level further modifies the mining speed for this mining "
"proeprty"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• A high difference in toughness levels decreases the mining time "
"considerably"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• If the toughness level difference is 2, the mining time is half of the "
"base mining time"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "• If the a difference of 3, the mining time is a third, and so on"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"The item help shows the mining times of a tool listed by its mining "
"properties and its ratings. The mining times are often expressed as a range. "
"The low number stands for the mining time for toughness level 0 and the high "
"number for the highest level the tool can mine."
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"Mining usually wears off tools. Each time you mine a block, your tool takes "
"some damage until it is destroyed eventually. The wear per mined block "
"determined by the difference between the tool's toughness level and the "
"block's toughness level. The higher the difference, the lower the wear. This "
"means:"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "• High-level blocks wear off your tools faster"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "• You can use high-level tools to compensate this"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"• The highest wear is caused when the level of both tool and block are equal"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid ""
"After mining, a block may leave a “drop” behind. This is a number of items "
"you get after mining. Most commonly, you will get the block itself. There "
"are other possibilities for a drop which depends on the block type. The "
"following drops are possible:"
msgstr ""

#: init.lua
msgid "• Always drops itself (the usual case)"
msgstr ""
